## Who can contribute?
Can you read this? Then you! Or anyone who's itching. Simply consult the short [style guidelines](style-guidelines.md) below to get familiar with our content standards (an old college try is probably sufficient).

## What needs contributed?
First off, go ahead and fork this guy for any addition or correction you're keen on making. If you see something that's inaccurate or ambiguous, go ahead and correct. Is there something you often find yourself repeating in e-mails or meetings you'd like to finally commit to a good write-up and just share the link? Draft it up! It' not just Software Developers who need to keep DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself).

## How do I contribute?
1. Fork
2. Change something (_after_ consulting the [style guidelines](style-guidelines.md)&mdash;they're reasonable!)
3. `git add` the change(s)
4. `git commit` with a useful commit message!
5. `git push`
6. Make a pull-request (shiny green button on the repo's GitHub webpage.)
7. (_optional_) Delete the fork once your changes are integrated if you like to keep a minimal repository ownership.

## Why should I contribute?
Something something good Samaritan, benefit the community, searchable knowledge-base, etc.
