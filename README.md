### Who can contribute?
Can you read this? Then you! Or anyone who's itching. Simply consult the short [style guidelines](style-guidelines.md) below to get familiar with our content standards (an old college try is probably sufficient).

### What needs contributed?
If you have a specific procedure for getting new-hires up-to-speed with your software stack or a convoluted process you'd like to capture all the details of, we encourage you to author or copy in some instructions and demos that will serve as an example for others to refer to. Things like demo job scripts, example source code, jupyter notebooks, and any other document-style formats that others could easily follow along with are welcome.

### How do I contribute?
1. Fork
2. Change something (_after_ consulting the [style guidelines](style-guidelines.md)&mdash;they're reasonable!)
3. `git add` the change(s)
4. `git commit` with a useful commit message!
5. `git push`
6. Make a pull-request (shiny green button on the repo's GitHub webpage.)

### Why should I contribute?
Something something good Samaritan, benefit the community, searchable knowledge-base, etc.
