1. The notebook used to create the slides can be found [here](conda_tutorial.ipynb).
2. The slides themselves don't render on GitHub, so if you'd like to interact with the content that way, download the .html file and open it in your browser.  The .html file can be found [here](conda_tutorial.slides.html)
