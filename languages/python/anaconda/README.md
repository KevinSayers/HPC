# Anaconda

1. The notebook used to create the slides on creating and maintaining Conda environments can be found [here](conda_tutorial.ipynb).
2. The slides themselves don't render on GitHub, so if you'd like to interact with the content that way, download the .html file and open it in your browser.  The .html file generated from the notebook can be found [here](conda_tutorial.slides.html)
